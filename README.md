# Mosaic Portfolio Layout

Project I put together to display various other projects on a web page in a mosaic pattern.  
For each project card, a picture of the project is displayed.  
When the project card is hovered over, the project's title, links to the GitHub repostitory and YouTube video of the project, and the icon/logo of the various technologies each individual project uses are displayed. 
The design is fully responsive. At screen sizes larger then 930px, the mosaic pattern is retained. At screen sizes smaller than 930px, the grid is tranformed from a mosaic layout to a one column layout for better display on mobile devices.
