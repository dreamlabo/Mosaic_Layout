# Mosaic Portfolio Layout

Project I put together to display various other projects on a web page in a mosaic pattern.  
Each project card displays a picture of the project and when the project card is hovered over, displays the project's title, links to the GitHub repostitory and YouTube video of the project, and the icon/logo of the various technologies each individual project uses. 

### Technologies Used
  * HTML
  * CSS
    * Specifically CSS-Grid
  * VS Code
